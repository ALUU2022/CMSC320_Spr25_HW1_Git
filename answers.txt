Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: To collaborate on projects with multiple people, from different places.  Seems like a good way to keep track of changes, have backups, and ways for people to iterate on a product.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Healthcare.  Data from patients is stored and retrieved in health databases, so healthcare professionals can reference the data and make informed clinical decisions.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging does not change existing branches.  Rebasing moves an entire branch into the main branch, integrating all of the commits--giving you a cleaner project history.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: Getting a better grasp on data science tools.  As a life science major, I'm super out of my element, but it's nice getting to genuinely learn so much new stuff.
